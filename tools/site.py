"""Generate the derived half of docs/ and check that the result is not lying.

Why this exists rather than a careful edit. The download page and the archive
listing carry facts about release artifacts -- file names, sizes, versions --
and those facts go stale every release. They have gone stale twice already and
nobody noticed either time: the download page was written against V1.1.0 asset
names, the archive against V1.0.0's, and by the time anyone looked all four ISO
links on the site returned 404 while the page still described them confidently.

That is a class of bug, not an instance. A site that states derived facts by
hand will state them wrongly, and the failure is silent because a stale link
looks exactly like a fresh one until somebody clicks it. So the derived regions
are emitted from the releases API, and `--check` fetches every download link
the site offers and fails on anything that does not answer.

The same argument covers the chrome. There is no templating in docs/; the nav
bar, sidebar and footer are duplicated inline across 34 files at two different
relative-path depths, which is 34 chances to update 33 of them.

    site.py --build            regenerate chrome and every derived region
    site.py --build --releases-json out/rel.json      without the network
    site.py --check            resolve every link, exit non-zero on any break

Follows the convention the rest of tools/ uses: say what could not be done
rather than skipping it quietly.
