"""Equihash, host-side: generate, verify, and solve slowly enough to be right.

`design/equihash.md` names the hazards of writing the GPU solver and four of the
five are invisible without this file:

  - the tree walk-back recovering 2^k indices from a chain of pair pointers, in
    the right order, where "an off-by-one produces solutions that look
    structurally perfect -- right length, right index count -- and fail
    verification. No partial credit, no useful error message."
  - ordering canonicalisation, which "get it wrong and solutions are valid
    XOR-wise and rejected by the pool", the same silent signature as a wrong
    personalisation string.
  - bucket overflow, which "does not crash and does not corrupt: it *lowers the
    solution rate*, which is indistinguishable from bad luck."
  - the per-coin personalisation, which is the one that bites first.

Every one of those is a solver that produces plausible garbage. So the verifier
comes first, and it is written from the specification rather than from the
solver, because a verifier derived from the thing it checks agrees with it and
with nothing else -- `model.rs` makes that objection twice and `differ.rs` was
written before there was anything to differ.

### Why it is generic over (n, k) when only 192,7 is wanted

Because 192,7 cannot be solved here. It needs 2^25 initial hashes and Wagner's
rounds over them, which is hours in Python and gigabytes. But (48,5) is 512
entries and (96,5) is 131,072, and both are *the same algorithm* -- the
parameters appear only as bit widths. So the verifier is exercised against real
solutions found by a reference solver at sizes where a laptop finds them in
milliseconds, and then the identical verifier is what the GPU's 192,7 solutions
are judged by.

That is the only way to have a trustworthy verifier before there is anything to
verify.

### The hash agrees with the device already

The generator here is `hashlib.blake2b` with `digest_size` and `person`, which is
what `cuda/blake2b.cuh` was checked against -- four vectors, identical, including
48 bytes out under `ZcashPoW`/192/7. So this file and the GPU share a hash
without sharing an implementation.
