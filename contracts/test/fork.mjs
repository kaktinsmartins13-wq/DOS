//   node test/fork.mjs <epoch.json> [--address 0x...]
//
// The real GLADOS contract, the real WETH/GLADOS pair, the real reserves and
// the real tax -- fetched over RPC as the EVM asks for them, so this is the
// chain as it actually is at the current block rather than a model of it. The
// distributor is deployed *into* the fork. Nothing is spent, nothing is
// published, and no key is needed.
//
// ### Why this is worth more than the mock
//
// `MockPair` proves the distributor's arithmetic against a pair that behaves
// the way this file's author believes a pair behaves. That is exactly the class
// of assumption this repository distrusts -- and it has already been wrong once
// here, in the mock's own `amountIn`. A fork removes the author from the
// question: the pair is the deployed bytecode, the tax is whatever the token
// does today, and the reserves are whatever the market left.
//
// What it still cannot prove is that anybody funded an epoch, and that the
// operator holds the key they think they hold.

// ### This is unreliable against the public RPC, and the failure is not ours
//
// `RPCStateManager` fetches each account lazily through `eth_getProof` and, when
// the provider does not answer, throws `Cannot read properties of undefined
// (reading 'balance')` from inside the EVM's gas handler. Robinhood Chain's
// public endpoint stops answering after enough calls in one run, so this file
// fails part-way through at a point that **moves between runs** -- sometimes at
// the miner's claim, sometimes at the burn.
//
// It is not a fault in the contracts and not in this harness's logic: the same
// code completed the claim leg and reported 420,575 GLADOS one run and died
// before it the next, against the same block.
//
// Two things were tried and neither is the answer. Seeding the addresses this
// file names -- the burn address, the stranger -- with `putAccount` and no read
// removes those fetches, and the failing one is a *callee* inside the token's own
// tax distribution, which this file cannot enumerate. And retrying would hide a
// real RPC failure behind a loop.
//
// What would fix it is an endpoint that answers every `eth_getProof`, which is
// what `GLADOS_RPC` is for. Until there is one, read a completed run as evidence
// and an incomplete one as no evidence, rather than as a failure.
