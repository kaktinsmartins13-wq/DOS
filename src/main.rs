//! glados -- a from-scratch ring-0 operating system for the MSI MS-16R8.
//!
//! There is no bootloader stage. UEFI has already put us in long mode, at
//! CPL 0, with an identity map, so this UEFI application simply *is* the
//! kernel: take what we need from the firmware, leave boot services, install
//! our own descriptor tables and page tables in place, and keep running. That
//! deletes ELF loading, relocation, and an entire handoff ABI -- the most
//! TempleOS-shaped option the hardware allows.

#![no_std]
#![no_main]
// Exception handlers need the compiler to emit an iretq-shaped prologue and
// epilogue, which no stable ABI provides.
