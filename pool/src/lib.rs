//! The pool that GLaDOS mines against.
//!
//! ### The kernel's source is included rather than ported
//!
//! A pool that accounts shares has to validate them, and validating a share
//! means computing the same hash the miner computed. A second implementation
//! of yespower, in another language, is two things that are supposed to agree
//! and will not stay agreeing -- the objection `model.rs` makes twice,
//! `tokenizer.py --verify` exists to answer, and `differ.rs` was written
//! before there was anything to differ.
//!
//! So the modules below are the kernel's own files, reached by `#[path]`. Not
//! copies: the same bytes the ring-0 miner compiles. A change to yespower that
//! breaks agreement is a build failure or a failing vector here, in the same
//! commit, rather than a share the pool rejects a week later for a reason
//! nobody can find.
//!
//! What that cost was, precisely, because it is the reason it is affordable at
//! all: `sha256`, `blake2s`, `u256`, `header` and `ev` name nothing outside
//! themselves. `hash` and `yespower` need `store::sha256` and `crypto::hkdf`.
//! `stratum` needs `json`. `json` needs one macro. That is the whole of it, and
//! the mirrored module tree below exists so those `crate::` paths mean here
//! what they mean there.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** included: `mine::client` and `mine::work`, which reach
//! for `net::tcp`, `task` and `sync`. Those are the kernel's answers to
//! problems the host solves with `std::net` and threads, and porting them
//! would be inventing a disagreement rather than avoiding one.
//!
//! ### This is the project's first `cargo test`
//!
//! CLAUDE.md's testing section opens "There is no `cargo test`", which is true
//! of a `no_std` UEFI binary and was true of everything inside it. The hash
//! core is not kernel code in any useful sense -- it touches no hardware and
//! allocates from a heap -- so on the host it is ordinary Rust, and the
//! vectors that cost a boot to check cost about a second.
//!
//! The boot claims stay exactly where they are. They check the same arithmetic
//! on the machine that will actually run it, which is the distinction
//! `diag paging` draws about permissions: reading a table back is not watching
//! the processor refuse.

// These were `pub mod store { #[path = "../../../src/store/sha256.rs"] ... }`,

// `pool/src/store/` -- a directory that does not exist. Windows collapses the
// `..` lexically before it reaches the filesystem and opens the file; Linux
// resolves each component and needs every one of them to be real, so it
// answers ENOENT. This crate therefore built on the development machine and
// had never once compiled on a runner, which is why `pool.yml` has failed
// every release it has ever run on.
//
// Pointing `#[path]` at the group names a directory that exists, and the
// modules inside resolve within it with no phantom traversal at all. It is
// also one line per group rather than one per module.
