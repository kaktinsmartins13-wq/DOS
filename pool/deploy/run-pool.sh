# The pool without systemd, for a machine where lingering cannot be enabled.
#
# `systemctl --user` is the better answer and this is not a replacement for it.
# It exists because `loginctl enable-linger` is governed by polkit and some
# systems will not grant it without an administrator -- and a user service
# without lingering stops at logout, which presents as a pool that works
# perfectly while you watch it and is gone in the morning.
#
# Deliberately POSIX `sh` and not bash: this has to run under whatever `cron`
# hands it, which on Debian-family systems is `/bin/sh` and is dash.
#
# Install:
#     mkdir -p ~/.local/bin ~/.local/state/glados-pool
#     install -m 0755 glados-pool  ~/.local/bin/
#     install -m 0755 run-pool.sh  ~/.local/bin/
#     crontab -e
#         @reboot /bin/sh $HOME/.local/bin/run-pool.sh
#     # and start it now without waiting for a reboot:
#     nohup ~/.local/bin/run-pool.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &

# `-u` and deliberately not `-e`. A supervisor should be hard to kill: `-e`
# turns any unexpected non-zero -- a `wc` on a log that vanished, a `mv` across
# a full disk -- into a pool that silently stops, which is the one behaviour
# this script exists to prevent. `-u` stays, because an unset variable here
# would expand to nothing and quietly point a path at the wrong place.

# The coins, and the only line here that is a decision rather than plumbing.
# `bits` is how many leading zero bits a share must have -- a difficulty said
# in a way that has no float in it. Twelve suits a laptop on yespower; sha256d
# and blake2s are thousands of times cheaper to check and can afford far more.
# `--cpu-percent` is the total validation budget, as a share of *one* core,
# and on a borrowed machine it is the setting that matters most. The
# per-connection rate limit does not sum -- 256 connections were never bounded
# in aggregate -- so this is what decides how much of somebody else's box a
# flood can take. 25% of one core is conservative on a four-thread 2012 i3 that
# is also serving media; raise it on a machine with headroom, or 0 for no cap.
#
# `--window` is the PPLNS payout window in work; a share credits 2^bits, so the
# default 2^32 is one difficulty-1 share's worth -- a starting point, and the
# reason `DEFAULT_WINDOW_WORK` says so. Leaving it default here was the same
# rounding error `run-pool.wg.sh` shipped explicitly: against Bitzeny it is
# 5e-5 of one block, so the window paid the last few shares and nothing else.
# 2^46 is about 0.80 of a Bitzeny block. See the longer note in the WireGuard
# script for why one block is the dial's midpoint and why there is no optimum.
#
# Bitcoin testnet is the other coin on this listener, and its difficulty swings
# by orders of magnitude under the 20-minute minimum-difficulty rule, so one
# window cannot be a considered choice for both. It is chosen for bitzeny, the
# coin this pool is actually pointed at, and the payout line prints what it is
# worth on each.
# `--roster` is the file `refresh_roster` below keeps current, and answering
# "can this name be paid" at the greeting is the whole point of it: a rig
# configured with an unregistered name otherwise mines perfectly for
# thirty-six hours and the first anybody hears of it is `distribute.py`
# printing "no payout address" after the event is over.
#
# **`--require-roster` is deliberately absent and is not an oversight.**
# Turning it on is a statement that a roster exists, and it refuses a miner at
# the greeting when it does not. `supabase/functions/worker` has to be deployed
# and answering before that sentence is true. Note the pool fails *open* on an
# unreadable roster either way and says so in its startup log -- read that line
# rather than assuming the flag is what decides.
#
# **No upstream, and where it goes when there is one is decided already.**
# `design/mining.md`'s sequencing item 8 is the only step in this whole project
# that has never been done -- "point the kernel at zpool's yespower port and
# take a real share", because everything green in this tree is green against our
# own stub -- and it says what it needs: "the address in hand and nothing else."
#
# A coin spec grows `@host:port,user,pass`, and zpool is **wallet-as-username**,
# which is why it is the venue: no account, no registration, and `payout.md`
# records it as the only anonymous yiimp pool of its kind still operating after
# zergpool, blockmasters, ahashpool and prohashing went. So **the username *is*
# the payout address**, and a placeholder left in place does not fail -- it mines
# to whoever owns that address. That is the one misconfiguration here that is
# silent, profitable for a stranger and irreversible, so the field is empty:
#
#     yespower:yespower-10-2048-8:12@<zpool yespower host>:<port>,<addr>,<pass>
#
# **The three placeholders are three different questions and none is guessable.**
# The host and port come off zpool.ca's own port list, the payout coin is
# selected through the password field by that pool's convention, and the address
# has to match whichever coin that is. None of them is written here because this
# tree's rule about inventing a plausible constant applies hardest to the field
# that decides who gets paid.
#
# **And it is not a BTC address**, which is worth saying because it is the
# obvious wrong answer. `payout.md`'s table prices zpool's three payout coins at
# this machine's measured $0.0703/day: DOGE clears its $0.42 threshold in 6
# days, LTC in 37, and **BTC in 825** -- so BTC is the one choice that makes a
# first payout longer than the project has existed. The other consideration
# pulls a different way: only Polygon is an Across origin into 4663, and zpool
# pays none of these on Polygon, so `runbook.md` step 6a prefers a venue that
# pays the token the bridge already takes. That is a decision, not a default.
#
# **Not sha256d either.** `mining.md` measures the kernel's CPU on yespower
# out-earning the RTX 3050 on sha256d by about eighteen hundred times, because
# sha256d is ASIC territory where a laptop is a rounding error while yespower is
# CPU-only by construction. `solo.ckpool.org` appears in `design/pool.md` and is
# **not** a candidate here: it was a plumbing test against something this
# project does not control, and solo Bitcoin from a laptop is a lottery ticket
# that `mine ev` says so about on every run.
#
# **One consequence for `--window` when this is wired.** 2^46 below is chosen as
# about 0.80 of a *Bitzeny* block. An auto-exchange port serves whatever coin is
# profitable at the time, so no single block time is the right one -- which is
# the argument for paying from the tally (`distribute.py --basis tally`) rather
# than from the PPLNS window, as `runbook.md` step 5 already prefers for a
# bounded event.
#
# Until one is set, every coin is `Source::Local`: the pool builds its own
# headers, so the shares are real proof of work against a target nobody else
# recognises, and the report says `local` on every row rather than implying
# otherwise.

# **Rotation had to stop happening only at restart, and a soak is what showed

# so the healthier the pool, the less often its log was checked, and a pool
# that simply never crashes never rotates at all. Measured on the deployed
# instance: about a kilobyte a minute with two miners on it, so 1.4 MB a day
# against a 4 MiB cap. Three days to the limit and then nothing, forever, on
# somebody else's disk.
#
# **`mv` is also the wrong verb while the pool is running.** The pool's stdout
# is an open descriptor onto this file; renaming it moves the name and not the
# descriptor, so the pool goes on writing into `pool.log.old` and `pool.log`
# stays empty at zero bytes -- which reads as a pool that stopped logging. It
# is correct only in the loop, between runs, where no descriptor is open.
#
# So there are two of them. `rotate_between_runs` keeps the rename, which is
# atomic and loses nothing. `watch_log` runs beside a live pool and copies then
# truncates: the redirection is `>>`, which is `O_APPEND`, so every subsequent
# write goes to the new end of a file that is now empty. Writes that land
# between the copy and the truncate are lost, which is a line or two of a log

# the user manager that lingering keeps alive, and `loginctl enable-linger` was
# denied there by polkit. So the two documented schedulers are a cron that does
# not exist and a timer that cannot run.
#
# This script is already a supervisor with a background loop in it, so the
# refresh costs one more `sh` loop and needs no scheduler at all. It dies with
# the script, which is the property that makes it safe to add.
#
# The `.tmp` and the `mv` are the point, and are the runbook's own reasoning:
# `mv` within one filesystem is atomic, so the pool never reads a half-written
# document. Writing straight to the file would hand it a truncated one to
# parse -- and although a parse failure leaves the previous roster in place,
# that is a safety net rather than a plan.

# script that is not coreutils, and the host that had no cron is exactly the
# sort that may not have it either. A missing `curl` logs one line and skips
# the loop rather than failing, because the pool fails open on an absent roster
# regardless -- so the honest outcome is a pool that runs and says why its
